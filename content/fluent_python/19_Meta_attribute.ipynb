He&#8217;s still recovering. A few years before that, he caused a privacy scandal by uncovering that your iPhone was <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/apple-location-tracking.html\">recording your location</a> all the time, which caused several class-action lawsuits and a US Senate hearing.

Prior to joining Nottingham he spent two years as a founder of Vipadia Limited designing and building the Clackpoint and Karaka real-time communications services (acquired by Voxeo Corp.), six years as a researcher with Microsoft Research Cambridge, and seven months as a visitor at Sprint <span class=\"caps\">ATL</span>, CA.

    "\n",
    "`__getattribute__`： 尝试获取指定的属性总会调用这个方法，不过，寻找的属性是特殊属性或特殊方法时除外。点号与 getattr 和 hasattr 内置函数会触发这个方法。调用 `__getattribute__` 方法且**抛出 AttributeError 异常时，才会调用** `__getattr__` 方法。为了获取 obj 实例属性不会无限递归，`__getattrbute__` 方法的实现要使用 `super().__getattrbute__(obj, name)` \n",

    "`__setattr__`： 尝试设置指定属性时总会调用这个方法，点号和 setattr 内置函数都会触发这个方法，例如 obj.attr = 42 和 setattr(obj, 'attr', 42) 都会触发 `Class.__setattr__(obj， 'attr', 42)` 方法。\n",
