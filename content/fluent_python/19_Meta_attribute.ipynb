He&#8217;s still recovering. A few years before that, he caused a privacy scandal by uncovering that your iPhone was <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/apple-location-tracking.html\">recording your location</a> all the time, which caused several class-action lawsuits and a US Senate hearing.

Prior to joining Nottingham he spent two years as a founder of Vipadia Limited designing and building the Clackpoint and Karaka real-time communications services (acquired by Voxeo Corp.), six years as a researcher with Microsoft Research Cambridge, and seven months as a visitor at Sprint <span class=\"caps\">ATL</span>, CA.
