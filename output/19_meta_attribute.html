<p>Python 中，数据的属性和处理数据的方法统称属性（attribute）。其实，方法只是可调用的属性。除了这二者之外，我们还可以创建特性（property），在不改变类接口的前提下，使用存取方法（即读值方法和设值方法）修改数据属性。</p>
<p>除了特性，Python 还提供了丰富的 API，用于控制属性的访问权限，以及实现动态属性。使用点号访问属性时，Python 会调用特殊的方法（如 <code>__getattr__</code> 和 <code>__setattr__</code>）计算属性。用户自定义的类可以通过 <code>__getattr__</code> 方法实现 “虚拟属性”，当访问不存在的属性时，即时计算属性值</p>
<p>动态创建属性是一种元变成，框架作者经常这么做，在 Python 中，这种技术很简单，任何人都可以使用，甚至在日常数据转换任务都能用到</p>

    'bio': '<p>Rachel Magario is an Assistive Technology Specialist at Pacer Simon Technology Center. As the first totally blind interaction designer, Rachel is known as a leader and visionary who has triumphed over adversity consistently throughout her life.</p>\n<p>Rachel has presented at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> Interactive and consulted for various companies and universities throughout the United States on accessibility. Rachel has an <span class="caps">MBA</span> with a concentration in Marketing and a Masters in Interaction design from the University of Kansas.</p>\n<p>Magario’s dream is that usability and accessibility can be considered from the start of a project and not as an after thought. She believes this would open the door for access of information and for accessible tools. This shift would allow her and others to pursue their careers of choice and live with the dignity that should be the right of every human.</p>\n<p>Rachel has been involved with accessibility consulting and advocacy since the early 2000s. Throughout the years, Rachel served as an accessibility consultant to several university related projects and non-profit sites that were required to comply with section 508.</p>\n<p>Rachel soon realized through her experience that accessibility issues often involve problems of usability that affect anyone who accesses information. When Rachel started her Masters in Interaction Design, she experienced the lack of accessibility in the design tools that she was using as well as in end products coming out of these tools.<br />\nSince then, Rachel has made her mission to research and develop models and prototypes of accessible user experience. She enjoys working closely with designers and developers to ensure standards are met and to create awareness of the importance of accessible user experience.</p>',
